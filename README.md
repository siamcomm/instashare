# InstaShare

WordPress Social Sharing Script

I am currently developing a WordPress plugin for this.
For now, you can download the files from here and include them in your WordPress theme.

## Installation

1. Copy the content of the `functions.php` file to the functions.php file in your currently active WordPress theme.

2. Copy the contents of the `style.css` file to the end of your themes style.css file.

3. Congratulations! You are ready to let your users share your content.

## Support

You can drop me a message here if you have any problems.

Check back often for the plugin.
